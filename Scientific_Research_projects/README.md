# Scientific Research Projects

This folder contains selected research projects from my academic work in Earth sciences and magnetism. These projects emphasize experimental design, reproducible analysis, and advanced modeling techniquesâ€”often in collaboration with multi-institutional teams.

Each project includes code used for data processing, statistical modeling, and visualization, with a focus on scientific clarity and reusability.

## Current Projects

- **Magnetic_Nanoparticle_Granulometry**  
  Data analysis pipeline for determining grain size distributions in nanometer-scale magnetic particles, based on low-temperature magnetic measurements.  
  *(Published: Bondar et al., 2025)*

Additional projects will be added as they are prepared for public release.
