# Dario Bilardello â€“ Data & Geoscience Portfolio

 Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. This space highlights select projects at the intersection of data analytics, environmental science, and geophysics. Projects here reflect a transition from a research-intensive background in Earth sciences to applied work in data science, with a focus on reproducible workflows, Python-based analysis, and real-world energy applications.

## Contents

### Data_Analyst_Projects/
Projects developed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (2025), focusing on exploratory data analysis, wrangling, visualization, and introductory machine learning.

- **Udacity_Advanced_Data_Wrangling**  
  Explores renewable energy production and consumption trends across U.S. states. Includes a supervised regression model and clustering to identify regional energy resilience patterns.  
  *Skills:* `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `data cleaning`, `ML modeling`

- **Udacity_Data_Visualization**  
  Investigates the solar augmentation potential of fossil power plants across 22 U.S. states. Geospatial analysis and custom visualizations highlight technology-specific and regional trends.  
  *Skills:* `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `GeoPandas`, `data storytelling`

### Scientific_Research_Projects
Projects from my academic research career in geophysics and magnetism.

- **Magnetic_Nanoparticles_Granulometry**  
  Peer-reviewed study (Bondar et al., 2025) on grain size distribution of nanometer-scale titano-magnetite particles using low-temperature frequency-dependent susceptibility and hysteresis data.  
  *Skills:* `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy.optimize`, `scipy.interpolate`, `scipy.special`, `matplotlib`

## About Me
I bring 15+ years of scientific research experience, now focused on applying data science skills to environmental, energy, and public sector challenges. My work emphasizes clarity, collaboration, and robust analytics.

Thanks for stopping by.
