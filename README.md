# Dario Bilardello â€“ Data & Geoscience Portfolio

 Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. This space highlights select projects at the intersection of data analytics, environmental science, and geophysics. Projects here reflect a transition from a research-intensive background in Earth sciences to applied work in data science, with a focus on reproducible workflows, Python-based analysis, and real-world energy applications.

## Contents

### Data_Analyst_Projects/
Projects developed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (2025), focusing on exploratory data analysis, wrangling, visualization, and introductory machine learning.

- **Udacity_Advanced_Data_Wrangling**  
  Explores renewable energy production and consumption trends across U.S. states. Includes a supervised regression model and clustering to identify regional energy resilience patterns.  
  *Skills:* pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, data cleaning, ML modeling

- **Udacity_Data_Visualization**  
  Investigates the solar augmentation potential of fossil power plants across 22 U.S. states. Geospatial analysis and custom visualizations highlight technology-specific and regional trends.  
  *Skills:* pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, GeoPandas, data storytelling

## About Me
I bring 15+ years of scientific research experience, now focused on applying data science skills to environmental, energy, and public sector challenges. My work emphasizes clarity, collaboration, and robust analytics.
