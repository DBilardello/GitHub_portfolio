# GitHub Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. These projects reflect a transition from a research-intensive background in Earth and Environmental Sciences to applied work in data analytics and machine learning. 

Each project was developed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree or through independent research initiatives. All work includes self-sourced datasets, rigorous data cleaning, and thorough documentation of the analytical process, with attention to reproducibility and clarity.

## Projects

### [Advanced Data Wrangling](./Data_Analyst_Projects/Udacity_Advanced_Data_Wrangling)
- Modeled renewable energy production-consumption dynamics across U.S. states using linear regression and clustering.
- Applied supervised ML to impute missing data and uncover regional trends in energy resilience.

### [Data Visualization](./Data_Analyst_Projects/Udacity_Data_Visualization)
- Conducted geospatial analysis on solar augmentation potential of fossil fuel power plants across 22 U.S. states.
- Created visualizations to identify high-value targets for solar retrofitting, by energy type and state.

> All projects demonstrate a full pipeline: data acquisition, wrangling, EDA, analysis/modeling, and communication of insights.
