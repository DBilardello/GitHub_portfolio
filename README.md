# Data Analyst Projects

This repository contains selected projects completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (2025). Each project involved defining an original problem, identifying and sourcing appropriate datasets, and applying rigorous data wrangling and analysis techniques to address real-world questions. Projects were required to demonstrate issues with data quality and structure, and include strategies for cleaning, reshaping, and validating data.

## Projects

- **Udacity_Adv_Data_Wrangling**  
  Cleaned and analyzed renewable energy production and consumption data across U.S. states. Included clustering analysis and supervised regression to identify regional patterns in energy resilience.

- **Udacity_Data_Visualization**  
  Developed geospatial visualizations of solar augmentation potential for fossil fuel power plants across 22 U.S. states, using data from NREL and EPRI. Focused on identifying high-impact sites based on augmentation potential and fossil fuel type.

Each project folder contains the original Jupyter Notebook(s), data files (where license permits), and a summary of key findings.
