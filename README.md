# GitHub Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. These projects reflect a transition from a research-intensive background in Earth and Environmental Sciences to applied work in data analytics and machine learning. 

Each project was developed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree or through independent research initiatives. All work includes self-sourced datasets, rigorous data cleaning, and thorough documentation of the analytical process, with attention to reproducibility and clarity.

## Projects

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Udacity_Advanced_Data_Wrangling**  
  Explores renewable energy production and consumption trends across U.S. states. Includes a supervised regression model and clustering to identify regional energy resilience patterns.  
  *Skills:* `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `data cleaning`, `ML modeling`

- **Udacity_Data_Visualization**  
  Investigates the solar augmentation potential of fossil power plants across 22 U.S. states. Geospatial analysis and custom visualizations highlight technology-specific and regional trends.  
  *Skills:* `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `GeoPandas`, `data storytelling`

### Scientific_Research_Projects
Projects from my academic research career in geophysics and magnetism.

- **Magnetic_Nanoparticles_Granulometry**  
  Peer-reviewed study (Bondar et al., 2025) on grain size distribution of nanometer-scale titano-magnetite particles using low-temperature frequency-dependent susceptibility and hysteresis data.  
  *Skills:* `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy.optimize`, `scipy.interpolate`, `scipy.special`, `matplotlib`
=======
### [Advanced Data Wrangling](./Data_Analyst_Projects/Udacity_Advanced_Data_Wrangling)
- Modeled renewable energy production-consumption dynamics across U.S. states using linear regression and clustering.
- Applied supervised ML to impute missing data and uncover regional trends in energy resilience.

### [Data Visualization](./Data_Analyst_Projects/Udacity_Data_Visualization)
- Conducted geospatial analysis on solar augmentation potential of fossil fuel power plants across 22 U.S. states.
- Created visualizations to identify high-value targets for solar retrofitting, by energy type and state.

> All projects demonstrate a full pipeline: data acquisition, wrangling, EDA, analysis/modeling, and communication of insights.
